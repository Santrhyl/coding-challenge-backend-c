# Busbud Coding Challenge

## Presentation

This project is a solution for the Busbud challenge available [here](https://github.com/busbud/coding-challenge-backend-c)

## Technical stack

I use NodeJs with Typescript.
CircleCI is the Continuous Integration.
There is a continuous deployment on Heroku. The application is available [here](https://busbud-challenge-gs.herokuapp.com/suggestions). You need to use
a rest client like [Restlet for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/restlet-client-rest-api-t/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm)

I will use [match-sorter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/match-sorter) to help to autocomplete + [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) concepts.

## Documentation

You can find a document for the rest endpoint [here](https://github.com/busbud/coding-challenge-backend-c)
